        - FATAL, not found: google/protobuf/compiler/code_generator.h 
    * download, install protobuf-2.5.0
    * protobuf-c make now fails because it can't load shared library
        libprotoc.so.8, which is actually in /usr/local/lib
        - ldconfig fixes
        - then make fails because Ubuntu has installed 2.4.1
        - edited Makefile to get this to run, replacing /usr/bin/protoc
            with /usr/local/bin/protoc
